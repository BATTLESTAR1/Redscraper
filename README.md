# Redscraper
a webscarper tool written with python for parsing html into readable text using the beautiful soup module on python .
on this project i used the "https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/" url for the testing .
using this code you input and display key words (html tags) for the specific results you want. 
Redscraper can be used for any static websites, e.g news websites which is why this tool is perfect for OSINT practioners and enthuthiasts.
